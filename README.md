## Pull Request Guidelines

When you're ready to create a pull request, please follow these guidelines for the title and description:

### Title

The title of your pull request should be concise and explains in a simple sentence what the pull request is about. It's often helpful to format the title like this: "Area: Short Description". For example, "Homepage: Add new project section".

### Description

The description of your pull request should provide detailed information about the changes you made. Here's a template you can use:

```
**What does this PR do?**
A clear and concise description of what the changes in this pull request do. For example, "Adds a new project section to the homepage".

**Why are these changes necessary?**
Explain why these changes need to be made. For example, "The homepage currently doesn't showcase any of my projects. This update allows visitors to see a selection of my work right on the homepage".

**How were these changes implemented?**
Describe how exactly you made these changes. For example, "Added a new section to the index.html file and updated the corresponding styles in style.css".

**Additional context**
Add any other information about the pull request here. For example, "This is a work in progress. I'm still waiting for final project images to add".
```

Remember, the more detailed and clear your pull request is, the easier it is for others to understand your changes and their purpose.

That's it! Your contributions will be reviewed, and if everything looks good, they will be merged into the main portfolio repository.
